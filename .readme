Cypress template.

All the tests are run from the integrations folder.
Softhouseday.feature works together with the corresponding folder/file (/softhouseday/softhouseday.js).

I am using cucumber.js to structure the test code with BDD scenarios in the .feature file.
The functions matching the scenario steps are found in the corresponding folder.

use cy.server() and cy.route() to communicate with the api.

If you want to do a real end-to-end test, simply do not add any response parameter to cy.route.
If you want to stub the result you get back from the api request, add response: "fixture:yourfile.json" to the cy.route(). See example.
In the fixtures folder you put your stubbed api request responses.

In the integration/examples folder you can see example on how to use cypress with mocha, end examples of alot of assertions.
To be able to run the tests in the integration/examples folder, you need to remove this line from cypress.json:
  "ignoreTestFiles": "!*.feature"

 Scripts:
 "e2e:open" will open the cypress dashboard where you can run tests through the browser.
 You can inspect network requests in the network tab and actions in the console tab.

 "e2e:run" will run the tests without a browser.
 If e2e:run encounters faliures screenshots will be saved in the screenshots folder. this feature can be turned of in the cypress.json file.
 e2e:run also record the test, saving it in the videos folder. This feature can also be switched off.

 The screenshots and videos folder will be cleared at the start of every e2e:run.

 There is great documentation on cypress.io.

 Happy coding! :)
